# Reproducible-Coding

https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction The Turing Way - a “lightly opinionated” guide to reproducible data science. This should cover most non-language-specific things about making your research as open and reusable as possible. It’s very good. I plan to contribute a couple of things soon.

 

https://whattheyforgot.org/ what they forgot to teach you about R – rough-and-ready materials for a workshop that covers some of the absolute basics that are rarely taught, leading to bad habits. For instance, if you have a `setwd()` anywhere in your script, you are – and I can’t emphasise this enough – DOING IT WRONG! Click the link to find out why.

https://happygitwithr.com/ Happy git with R – a good guide for getting started with github and R. I used this my first time and it’s good.

 

https://style.tidyverse.org/ a R style guide - advice for code organisation, naming conventions, commenting, etc. Some aspects of style are arbitrary so this is just one example of many different approaches, implemented in the `styler` package/ RStudio add-in. Much better to stick to an imperfect style guide than be inconsistent!
